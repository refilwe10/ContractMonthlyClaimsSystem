It provides *role-based dashboards* for:
- *Lecturers* – Submit claims, upload documents, view claim status.
- *Coordinators* – Review, approve, or reject claims.
- *Managers* – Provide final approval before payment processing.

This project was created as part of a POE assignment and focuses on demonstrating *UI/UX design, role workflows, and prototype functionality*.
